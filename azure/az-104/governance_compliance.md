# Governance and Compliance

## Managing subscriptions
* A subscription is the billing unit we use to aggregate our cloud costs that exist inside the subscription. 
* Subscriptions contain resource groups and their associated resources
* Provide a level of scoping for governance and security eg split by environment or team or business area or application domain
* There are different types of subscriptions (free, pay-as-you-go etc) available.

### Popular subscription splits
* By environment. For example Development, Staging and Production
* By department / team. For example Marketing, Data Modeling, Accounting
* By region. For example UKSouth and UKWest
